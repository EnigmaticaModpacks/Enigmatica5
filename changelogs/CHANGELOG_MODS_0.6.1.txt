		DungeonCrawl-1.15.2-2.1.0:
			Dungeon Crawl 2.1.0
			AS OF VERSION 2.1.0, DUNGEON CRAWL IS PUBLISHED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE [GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE v. 3]()
			Monster Changes:
			* The monster spawner system is now datapack driven, allowing for customization
			* Monsters will now have potion effects by default in the lower layers
			* Added wither skeletons to the layers 3, 4 and 5 (they can't drop skulls)
			Other:
			* BREAKING CHANGE: Renamed the "stage" parameter for the loot functions to "loot_level"
			* Added a "solid" option to the config that disables the dungeon ripping itself apart to match the worldgen ([#38](https://github.com/XYROC/DungeonCrawl/issues/38))
			* Added an option to register dummy pieces for pre-2.0.0 dungeons on startup. (NOT TESTED because i am unable to reproduce the crash for some reason)
			* Nerfed the loot enchantment level per stage from 10/15/20/25/30 to 10/13/16/19/22
			* Introduced a new theme-driven decoration system. Themes (not sub-themes) can now have a list of decorations, e.g. vines like in the mossy layers
			* Themes can now also force a sub-theme (or a sub-theme randomizer) to be used with them
			* The dungeons now imitate vanilla's structure separation system, because it is not possible to actually hook into it right now. This fixes the weird and inconsistent generation. ([#34](https://github.com/XYROC/DungeonCrawl/issues/34))
			* Added some new corridor and node models for the nether layer
			* Added a new loot room model (the old one won't get used by default anymore)

			* Fixed monsters in stage 4 and 5 getting equipped with stage 1 items
			* Fixed vines getting placed wrongly sometimes ([#39](https://github.com/XYROC/DungeonCrawl/issues/39))
			* Fixed a deadlock issue ([#35](https://github.com/XYROC/DungeonCrawl/issues/35))

			Improve multi-warehouse support Courier assign themselves to the closest one with open spots around them. Improve chunk claim message a bit. * Raid biome chance and some fixes (#5756) * Fix build error (#5749)
			Fix the build error introduced by my last pr. Sorry, i misclicked when making the last pr causing the import to get deleted instead of being added to the class, i should have double checked it again. * Fix AbstractEntityAIStructureWithWorkOrder.java (#5748)
			Fix AbstractEntityAIStructureWithWorkOrder.java sending an incorrect chat message after finishing deconstructing a building. * Add citizens complaining about no guard nearby (#5744)

			This adds two gate blocks, one wooden one iron which are craftable by the mechanic. Those have a max size of 5x4 and combine their hardness depending on size and act like vanilla doors, so that citizens and any other door using mechanic should work with them.
			Fix raiders still using their old anti-stuck mechanics in addition to the new stuckhandler ones. Fix herder trying to breed with one item. Fix raid difficulty starting at zero * Improve tool usage in the cook and other crafters (#5728)

			Builder not getting stuck anymore in deconstruct Fix visitor wandering * Adds more dynamic difficulty to raids (#5726)
			Colonies now have an individual raid difficulty, increasing and decreasing with success of raids for a better balanced experience. Colonies start with the lowest difficulty. Difficulty scales between 20% and 200%. Raids start happening based on a minimum raidlevel instead of plain citizencount now.
			Extra difficulty utlities for raiders:
			Teaming up: raiders get put on the same scoreboard team so they cannot hurt eachother Movementspeed bonus: Raiders can get a bit faster, letting them catch up to players better (high difficulty) Archer arrows can get pierce effect Archers gain range through difficulty Melees get slightly increased hit range at high difficulty Citizen homes and Tavern recruits now have spawntimes in relation to missing citizen count, allowing for easier recruiting.
			Fix paths not properly getting their target position and reach target flags in the pathfinding. Fix guards sometimes starting to eat mid-combat due to not resetting their fight timer Fix a bug where randomPos sometimes returns non-air positions. * Delivery fixes (#5733)
			Vastly improve smelter crafter madness Add some safeguards to racks * Feature/border announcement (#5734)
			Adds player announcement regarding the change in colony size when a build is completed. Tells the player how to increase their colony size when they try and place a building outside the colony * Delivery fixed (#5725)
			Fixes dman not delivering enough Fixes dman recovery Remove unnecessary copy operations * fix warehouse oopsy (#5723)
			Fix warehouse for stack list requests * Small fix (#5719)
			This has a minor dyer fix This also goes back to explicit structurize versions. We always want people to use the newest and not a range of it anyway.
