	Apotheosis (Apotheosis-1.15.2-3.1.2.jar --> Apotheosis-1.15.2-3.2.2.jar):
		Apotheosis-1.15.2-3.2.2.jar:
			Fixed an advancement typo.
			Rebalanced a few enchanting stat values. The 50 eterna / 0 quanta / 100 arcana setup should now be possible.
			Feather falling is now a boot only enchantment once again.

		Apotheosis-1.15.2-3.2.1.jar:
			Includes a patch for quark breaking the enchantment module.

		Apotheosis-1.15.2-3.2.0.jar:
			Apotheosis 3.2.0 is here, this is the Enchantment Rework, along with a ton of other changes.
			General
			-A lot of configs have changed. I'd suggest you regenerate them if possible.
			Enchantment Rework
			-Enchanting has been changed significantly. There are now three stats, Eterna, Quanta, and Arcana. Eterna controls the level, Quanta is how much fluctuation there is, and Arcana provides more and better enchantments.
			-Bookshelves provide these stats. (In a future update these stats will be a datapack feature and could be on anything). Mod blocks that provide enchanting power will provide Eterna.
			-A significant number of Apotheosis and Vanilla enchantments have been updated in some way, form or fashion.
			-Mounted Strike has been removed.
			-Miner's Fervor has been changed. It's effect now forces your mining speed to a fixed amount.
			-The "Merge All" anvil config feature has been removed.
			-Native Enchantment Tooltips have been removed. Use the "Enchantment Descriptions" mod instead.
			-Bane of Arthropods and Smite are no longer exclusive with Sharpness. The same for Fire/Blast/Projectile Protection and Protection.
			Advancements
			-There are now a suite of new advancements for Enchanting, Spawners, and the Affix Loot system.
			Potion Charms
			-The invisibility charm has been removed. In it's place is a dynamic potion charm, which can accept any type of potion, be equipped as a charm (Curios Integration), and provides 8 times the original duration of the consumed potions.
			Affixes
			-Surface Boss Spawns now only occur when the sky is visible (no longer in the nether or the end). The lightning and frequency of these spawns is also configurable.
			-The Wandering Merchant will now sell affix items.
			Quark
			-This enchantment rework renders this module fully incompatible with Quark Matrix Enchanting.
			-Additionally, a bug has been discovered where if the quark Ancient Tomes module is enabled, the anvils will cease their ability to convert books any more than one above the vanilla max.
			-When playing with quark, these modules should be disabled.
			Spawner
			-Defaults have been introduced for all types of spawner modifiers. These caps are displayed in JEI. Previously caps were configurable, but defaulted to [0, infinity]

	FastWorkbench (FastWorkbench-1.15.2-3.0.0.jar --> FastWorkbench-1.15.2-3.1.1.jar):
		FastWorkbench-1.15.2-3.1.1.jar:
			Removes debug print that was accidentally left in.

		FastWorkbench-1.15.2-3.1.0.jar:
			(1.16.1 backport)
			Significant improvements have been made to the general systems in place.
			Overall: Less packets are being sent, less items are being shifted around, and everything should just run a bit better. There's less duplication of objects, and a ton of the code is now more extensible (meaning mods can interface with FB way easier now!) and reusable.
			Additionally, the player crafting grid is now supported, so you can craft lag-free in the 2x2 grid. This part requires a coremod, but it is done as non-invasively as possible (it requires two hooks, one to properly handle shift click crafting and one to handle grid updates). Both hooks just call code that FastBench uses for the 3x3 crafting table, with nearly nothing special needed for this support. Any mod wanting to support their own custom crafting grid should be able to do so in a similar fashion.
			This is marked as beta as this is largely untested with mods, but it works perfectly in a vanilla environment.

			Minecolonies Changelog
			Version: 0.13.28-BETA
			* Show schematic outlines while the player has the building tool in the main hand - 2nd try (#5345)
			This PR makes it so the building tool will render the max-level building schematics and their outlines when the active preview is nearby. This should make it easier to properly align neighboring buildings. * Add crafting to the farmer (#5373)
			Make the farmer a public crafter Add carved pumpkin recipe to farmer Allow the farmer to make Hay Bales and seeds Add smooth sandstone variants to stone smelter Add prismarine shards/crystals to stone mason Add Sea Lantern to Mechanic * Fix stone tools - additional rules take precedence (#5374)
			Force additional rules if true to take precedence over tags, which lets the blacksmith make stone tools/weapons * Fixed lumberjack crafting (was broken due to commit dc4e169). Now both work together. (#5370)
			Fixes missing craft-request check, introduced by dc4e169. Calls tryUnstuck as the first step in the AI's decision-making process, to make sure it tries to free itself as often and early as possible. Migrated recipe-registration of LJ to new checkForWorkerSpecificRecipes() mechanism. Fixed a possible nptr exception (happened once on a testing world) during unstucking. * Add batching to miner resource request when mining (#5364)

			* Adds shears and furnace to worker's recipes (#5314)
			Fix worker recipes * Feature/buckets (#5312)
			Prefetch materials for builder * Improve construction tape (#5298)
			Construction tape now behaves like a four way block, connecting to tape in all four directions, with the following exceptions: Tape will remember it is a corner even when isolated (unchanged from previous) Tape will not become a T-junction if it means it will face another T-Junction stem-to-stem. This produces a neat result when building schematics adjacent to one another (makes more sense in the picture) Tape is now water-loggable, meaning tape can be (and is) placed in water As a side-effect the tape now sometimes blocks adjacent water sources from flowing in its direction Tape placed by the helper (when placing buildings) now replaces flowers Tape placed by the helper (when placing buildings) now ignores leaves, replacing them if necessary. * Schematics115 (#5308)
