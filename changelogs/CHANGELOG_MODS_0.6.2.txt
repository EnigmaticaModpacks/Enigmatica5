			Version: 0.13.322-ALPHA
			* Rewrite of door/gate/trapdoor toggle AI (#5886)
			Rewrite of door/gate/trapdoor toggle AI, this lets us use the same AI for blocks with similar toggle behaviour. The idea is the same as the fenceGateAI before: we check the parts of path for toggleable blocks in range, and save their positions(previously we could only use one position). If we found some blocks the AI becomes active, while active it randomly activates one of the blocks it found. With multiple blocks in range it eventually finds a combination which allows it to go through.
			Pathing now allows single trapdoor blocks as passable. Pathing now also adds the starting node to the path, previously only nodes with a parent were added.
			Example of what they now make their way through:

So that we then have citizens more beeing able to reach higher levels like 45+ while not reducing the inital levels xp much.

			Enhanced durability research for gates against multiple raiders Add debug for visitors getting to zero pos * Fix/multiples (#5862)
			Better stat inheritance Increased pupil leveling Warehouse resolving to closest Remove recall all at townhall Add recall to citizen hut Fix team display on client side Vastly improve multiwarehouse research assignment Add some more info to delivery requests * Fix NRE when research missing (#5863)
			fix a missing null check on research existence * Tackle some things from Modtoberfest list (#5853)
			Fix research GUI to display arrows correctly * Replace a common NRE with a warning (#5858)
			This is mostly a logging change, to log a one line warning rather than a full stack This does enable the removal of the bad task from the queue when the NRE skipped that. * Break up big crafting jobs (#5852)
			Break crafting jobs into chunks based on the ingredients fitting in the inventory of the crafter This resolves the problem with cases where a crafting job requires more slots to load the recipe than the citizen has available. this becomes very visible when the recipe uses an ingredient with a maxStackSize of 1, and the output stacks higher than the number of inventory slots on the citizen.
			Today, we have a special recipe for level 3 bakery that uses water bottles, and making a stack of that recipe needs 32 of those, with a total slot requirement of 33 + 1 for output.
			The solution is to recognize the max recipe iterations we can load inputs for, and instead of creating a single crafting job of the full amount, calculate the maximum size we can process, and break it up into batches of that or smaller to accomplish the task. * fix fuel when furnace goes missing (#5851)
			If the furnace position doesn't have a furnace, remove it from the list and move on. * Upgradeable fortress walls (#5855)
			Fix null schematic name and level in the NBT preventing deco upgrade * Language adjustments & fix double claiming (#5849)
			Fixed the inconsistent raid messages The research start message is more descriptive Added missing scepter names and missing advancement description Removed Asher's fascination with towers ... and with exclamation marks Some more interesting titles were attempted for some advancements Some advancements' tooltips have been made more brief The Barrel is now called the Compost Barrel (seriously, confused me when I rejoined mc in 1.15) Players can no longer change styles when upgrading a hut Fixes chunk claiming happening twice * Short type based serialization for packets (#5844)

			* Fix some counting errors leading to stuck crafters (#5810)
			Fix the logic around counting tools during crafting add a few more recipes as allowable to the mechanic * Rework the baker to be a real smeltercrafter (#5785)
			The baker is now a true crafter, and will bake on-demand The baker no longer bakes as long as it has resources, but now supports prestock to force baking. Baker recipes reworked, and now have doughs that the baker crafts, and then cooks in the ovens to produce final result. Reworked the way all the smeltercrafters handle fuel management. It is much faster and more reliable now. Fixed quite a few small issues across the crafting and display code, especially around NBT handling - This will better support potions in the future. * Schematics115 (#5799)
			New Scans for all but Medieval * Raidfixes and adjustments (#5803)
			Fix citizen home dist complains Fix raids re-appearing the next day
			Improve raid difficulty scaling to a more flat curve(weakest-strongest 3x instead of previously 10x stronger), aswell as making the difficulty increases less agressive. Improve raid calculation for the next day, on nightfall we now either trigger a raid, or check if next day should get a raid. Moved up night time slightly so that night triggers of the colony no longer can get skipped through sleeping * Some fixes (#5804)
			Fix rack placement Fix NPE Display crafter list Fix guard tower pos.

			Minecolonies Changelog
			Version: 0.13.250-BETA
			* Some fixes (#5762)
			Fix entity AI active too early, causing a crash Fix respawning missing checks Remove entity respawning at the TH when actually unloaded Fix can't spawn at messages appearing for unloaded citizens * Fix/multi warehouses (#5757)
			Improve multi-warehouse support Courier assign themselves to the closest one with open spots around them. Improve chunk claim message a bit. * Raid biome chance and some fixes (#5756) * Fix build error (#5749)
			Fix the build error introduced by my last pr. Sorry, i misclicked when making the last pr causing the import to get deleted instead of being added to the class, i should have double checked it again. * Fix AbstractEntityAIStructureWithWorkOrder.java (#5748)
			Fix AbstractEntityAIStructureWithWorkOrder.java sending an incorrect chat message after finishing deconstructing a building. * Add citizens complaining about no guard nearby (#5744)
			Citizens now occasionally complain about having no guard building nearby their home or work buildings. Guard happiness modifier now only requires 2/3 of worker to guard ratio, compared to previously 1:1 * Adds gate blocks, for additional raid protection (#5727)
			This adds two gate blocks, one wooden one iron which are craftable by the mechanic. Those have a max size of 5x4 and combine their hardness depending on size and act like vanilla doors, so that citizens and any other door using mechanic should work with them.
			Fix raiders still using their old anti-stuck mechanics in addition to the new stuckhandler ones. Fix herder trying to breed with one item. Fix raid difficulty starting at zero * Improve tool usage in the cook and other crafters (#5728)
			fix tool usage for larger stacks during crafting add haybale decompression to farmer bit of cleanup here and there. Make compost a bit cheaper fix ingredient resolution for cookable foods - prestock of cookables should work now. * fix builder getting stuck, fix visitor wander (#5737)
			Builder not getting stuck anymore in deconstruct Fix visitor wandering * Adds more dynamic difficulty to raids (#5726)
			Colonies now have an individual raid difficulty, increasing and decreasing with success of raids for a better balanced experience. Colonies start with the lowest difficulty. Difficulty scales between 20% and 200%. Raids start happening based on a minimum raidlevel instead of plain citizencount now.
			Extra difficulty utlities for raiders:
			Teaming up: raiders get put on the same scoreboard team so they cannot hurt eachother Movementspeed bonus: Raiders can get a bit faster, letting them catch up to players better (high difficulty) Archer arrows can get pierce effect Archers gain range through difficulty Melees get slightly increased hit range at high difficulty Citizen homes and Tavern recruits now have spawntimes in relation to missing citizen count, allowing for easier recruiting.
			Fix paths not properly getting their target position and reach target flags in the pathfinding. Fix guards sometimes starting to eat mid-combat due to not resetting their fight timer Fix a bug where randomPos sometimes returns non-air positions. * Delivery fixes (#5733)
			Vastly improve smelter crafter madness Add some safeguards to racks * Feature/border announcement (#5734)
			Adds player announcement regarding the change in colony size when a build is completed. Tells the player how to increase their colony size when they try and place a building outside the colony * Delivery fixed (#5725)
			Fixes dman not delivering enough Fixes dman recovery Remove unnecessary copy operations * fix warehouse oopsy (#5723)
			Fix warehouse for stack list requests * Small fix (#5719)
			This has a minor dyer fix This also goes back to explicit structurize versions. We always want people to use the newest and not a range of it anyway.
