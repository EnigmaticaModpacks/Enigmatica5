	Interactio - In-World Crafting with Datapacks! (Interactio-1.15.2-2.0.3.jar --> Interactio-1.15.2-3.0.0.jar):
		Interactio-1.15.2-3.0.0.jar:
			Please note: Only the 1.16.1 version of this release has been tested thoroughly, which is why the other two will be marked as a beta!
			To see the full list of changes, feel free to check out the [lag-fixes-mixins](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/tree/lag-fixes-mixins) branch on GitHub!
			This update should hopefully address some performance issues by completely rewriting how crafting checks for in-world recipes are done:
			Instead of using the world tick event, this mod now uses mixins into ItemEntity, which should hopefully improve performance by a significant margin (and actually makes my work a fair bit easier as well)
			Here's a short summary of the most important changes (as well as links to the relevant commits):
			[- Stop recipe cache from going through recipes again if none are registered](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/b30f26169a7290069f52cc684a9ed4a2dd32ab44)
			[- Remove useless "busy" list of items (idk why it even existed anymore)](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/ede22181184370224ecce8052b3acbe9d9705b31)
			[- Comparing stacks should now be done more efficiently: replace required ingredient list w/ set](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/8c22d5df3f229023382bae1b47c85555d70c57a7)
			* [Remove unnecessary duplicate canCraft checks](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/37df60855de69efd8c3fcbdd041ad9fa9e6d59a1)
			[- Fluid recipes now use mixins instead of an Event Handler](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/c27dc9c44a3efc32f15d784908d1f91e767e6ac5)
			[- Remove DroppedItemHandler, it's no longer needed](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/ba45a65b590e93295bd72e26b92808fa81bad159)
			Again, all of these changes are purely for performance reasons and nothing should have functionally changed, however, I am still bumping the mod version up to 3.0 as
			(a) The switch to mixins as well as these other changes are pretty significant and "major" on their own and
			(b) I frankly just wanted all the versions to line up again.

		Interactio-1.15.2-2.0.6.jar:
			[- Replace NonNullLists in per-tick checks with sets](https://github.com/MaxNeedsSnacks/Interactio/commit/5f5437da0f91fb193f38648980bee6ee460287a8)
			This should hopefully improve the runtime for both fluid-based recipes dramatically! Thanks to Darkere for discovering this!

			Minecolonies Changelog
			Version: 0.13.235-ALPHA
			* Adds more dynamic difficulty to raids (#5726)
			Colonies now have an individual raid difficulty, increasing and decreasing with success of raids for a better balanced experience. Colonies start with the lowest difficulty. Difficulty scales between 20% and 200%. Raids start happening based on a minimum raidlevel instead of plain citizencount now.
			Extra difficulty utlities for raiders:
			Teaming up: raiders get put on the same scoreboard team so they cannot hurt eachother Movementspeed bonus: Raiders can get a bit faster, letting them catch up to players better (high difficulty) Archer arrows can get pierce effect Archers gain range through difficulty Melees get slightly increased hit range at high difficulty Citizen homes and Tavern recruits now have spawntimes in relation to missing citizen count, allowing for easier recruiting.
			Fix paths not properly getting their target position and reach target flags in the pathfinding. Fix guards sometimes starting to eat mid-combat due to not resetting their fight timer Fix a bug where randomPos sometimes returns non-air positions. * Delivery fixes (#5733)
			Vastly improve smelter crafter madness Add some safeguards to racks

			Adjust to newest structurize Fix crusher Multi-tick builder material request * Guard improvements (#5481)
			Guards received 3 new researchable abilities: - Arrow usage, consumes arrows and increases damage - Arrow piercing, arrows pierce two targets. This one should help with ranger's arrows beeing caught by knights on the frontline aswell. - Knockback aoe, Knights get an aoe knockback dealing a little damage and knocking back surrounding enemies. Chance to use on hit and has a cooldown of 30 seconds. Should lead to more balanced fighting and less many vs one situations.
			Knights can use shields at any levels once researched. Knights have higher hp scaling aswell as the scaling based on the skill instead of arbitrary worker level. Knights no longer unintentionally scale in damage. Rangers have higher base range. Rangers distance now scales with Adaptability instead of job level. Rangers no longer scale in health with their level, only with their buildings level. Rangers now are able to shoot better when stationed ontop of buildings, gaining extra range, patrol to edges where they can see far and are chasing mobs into vision from above without using ladders.
			Guards now can give other patrolling guards a temporary consumed patrol position, when encountering raiders so they help each other out better. Fleeing citizens now call the two closest guards instead of one.
			Guards now properly equip the armor from their inventory upon starting to fight. They also now dump their inventory occasionally when patrolling/guarding and upon dump they check their hut for armor/better armor and request any missing.
			Guards combat now is active in almost all worker AI states, so that they always can react when getting hit. They do not search for targets though when doing non guard task stuff. * Fix typo and upgrade issues (#5476)
			Fix a nasty typo in a conditional comparison Add a safety net for 'half processed' jobs during upgrade * Perf improvements (#5482)
			Fix pickup requests getting marked as received for cleanup. Replace a bunch of chunk loaded checks with the more complete check. Revert the creation of the combined itemhandler to happen each tick. * Gpl to jar (#5475)
			* push forge version
			* add license

		minecolonies-0.13.81-RELEASE-universal.jar:
			Minecolonies Changelog
			Version: 0.13.81-RELEASE
			* Fix/lag (#5469)
			Bunch of performance improvements * Upgrade the cook, and a few more recipes (#5383)
			The cook will try to resolve furnace recipes (for food) without being taught. The cook has a new assistant who does all the crafting, leaving the cook to focus on serving the colony, and basic cooking. The cook's assistant is able to be hired at building level 3 The cook (and other crafters) will better handle secondary outputs for recipes. (1 pot for a full stack of output!) The cook will now stop 'auto smelting' food while working on specific recipes, to avoid stealing from itself Enable the crusher to convert/decompress clay blocks into clay balls - Bricks, bricks galore! The farmer is now capable of learning the composted dirt recipe All pressure plates are now crafted at the mechanic. As a 2x2 recipe, the builders can also craft for themselves. Miscellaneous cleanup of unnecessary imports, as a result of my previous changes. * Fix/dman (#5461)
			Let dman refresh activity also for pickups after becoming active again Refresh pickup tasks regularly at worker level. * Smeltercrafter/reliability (#5455)
			Make the smeltercrafters track what is in furnaces better, and what they pull out Fix AI Error due to no defined fuels. Tweak fuel handling behavior further to fall in line with upgraded tracking * Fix/warehouse (#5459) * Updates Bug Report template to show in GitHub (#5454)
			Updates Bug Report template to show in GitHub * Performance improvement TEs (#5435)
			Closes #5402 Closes #5420 Closes #5382 Closes #5431
			Use our own dirty setting mechanic for our tileEntities. Vanilla causes a lot of stuff because of comparator output updates we don't need * Adds template data for issues templates (#5449)
			Adds template data for issues templates * Let the warehouse use the rack-maps for speed (#5391)
			Modify the warehouse resolver to use a fast path for single stack requests * use constants * Feature/GitHub templates (#5448)

			Fix traveler spawn half inside a wall * Schematics115 (#5406)
			Rabbit hutch fixes, asian mechanic and other small fixes * Better optimize fuel handling (#5424)
			move fuel grabbing a little later in the process, to speed smelting/crafting behavior make sure that we don't hit a case where the crafter decides to do nothing but play with fuel make smeltercrafter hold on to fuel in inventory better, to compensate for the later grab. * add cmment * fix chunklpading (#5427)

			SmelterCrafters checks fuel status far more often, and before crafting. SmelterCrafters properly limit fuel decisions to allowable fuels * Hotfix/farmer (#5412)
			A field size of 0, 0, 0, 0 no longer gives a NullPointerException Uses different tag names for compatibility with existing schematics. (the new system uses the tags differently, so we want it to be 5 by default in existing schematics, not 0) * Fix cowboy breeding cows he wants to murder (#5416)
			Fix cowboy breeding cows he wants to murder * Add stuckhandler to navigator (#5387)
			Adds a new stuckhandler directly to the navigator.
			It tries to unstuck the entity with various options, depending on which are enabled. Less invasive ones are tried first and more often. Stuck detection is split in somewhat stuck and completely stuck, when unstuck measures did not work. Our citizens are using teleport steps as normal unstuck option, allowing them to skip ahead on a valid path when not advancing for some reason. On total stuck they teleport right to their goal, making sure they arrive. Before teleporting clearing/moving away is tried. This fixes our current issues with citizens getting stuck forever frequently. * Fix sleeping (#5414)
			Fix old sleep positions persisting, even when changing home * fix #5365 (#5407)
			Fixes the issue of diverging opinions about the solid substitution blocks Fixes confused miner * bump structurize * half a block * Add visible status indicators for citizens (#5371)
			-Add visible status indicators for citizens * Carlansor models improvements (#5393)
			Bunch of model improvements Should fix sick guards running around Improves path speed on grass paths * Skip the Chit-Chat (#5399)
			Quick way to opt out from a bunch of chat interactions quickly. Fix some small bugs * Adjustable Field Size (#5386)
			The scarecrow field GUI has four new directional buttons Tooltips help the player orientate themselves Buttons in scarecrow GUI control how large the worked plot size of the field is (buttons toggle 0 through 5) Farmer AI (EntityAIWorkFarmer) will skip over blocks outside the defined size without requiring a new worker tick each time * Tavern2 (#5355)
			Adds a new feature which spawns visitors to the tavern, which a player then can recruit for varying costs. For that it adds a new interaction type called recruitmentinteraction, which displays and handles the item stack cost for recruitment. The costs for recruitment are loaded from the config, with given item and weight on it. Interactions now are able to return the icon supposed to render for it. Interaction responses now are kept in insertion order instead of random hashmap order Interactions now know the player its interaction it, rather than the world. Added a WorldUtil class with helper functions for checking chunk load status properly Added a schematic constants class, for string tags used in schematics. Should be in sync with the builder's tag list.
			Fixes: Fix bed pos and last pos getting written to the same nbt tag, overwriting eachother. Fix guards not moving out when fired. Fix tavern music only playing when you were close enough when it started Fix raider respawns, when sometimes an entity gets into an unloaded chunk but not removed Fix claim command requiring an existing colony, so you now can unclaim already deleted colonies Fix whereami command distance output Fix loading chunks on entity enter event * Inventory util/debug (#5394)
			*
			Add a utility function for gathering itemstorage from inventories Add a debug check for Builder hut items transfer and Request item transfer messages
			*
			Fix counting with a different predicate than finding stacks to extract. Fix trying to insert more than max stacks
			* Schematics115 (#5388)
			Schematic fixes and adds * Fix dyer and concretemixer (#5385)
			Add non-placeholder UI to the Dyer, so that you can define fuel and thus actually craft green dye Stop concrete mixer from mixing any and all powder, Now it will only mix what is requested * Add breeding toggle for herders (#5380)
			Add a Button to the second page of the cowboy, shepard and chicken herder to disable them breeding the animals. * Beekeeper quickfixes (#5375)
			Add some en-us string translations to help the UI make sense -Fix the max hives to be non-zero at level one. -Fix the beekeeper losing track of hives as fast as they are added, and constantly complaining about no hives * Show schematic outlines while the player has the building tool in the main hand - 2nd try (#5345)
			This PR makes it so the building tool will render the max-level building schematics and their outlines when the active preview is nearby. This should make it easier to properly align neighboring buildings. * Add crafting to the farmer (#5373)
			Make the farmer a public crafter Add carved pumpkin recipe to farmer Allow the farmer to make Hay Bales and seeds Add smooth sandstone variants to stone smelter Add prismarine shards/crystals to stone mason Add Sea Lantern to Mechanic * Fix stone tools - additional rules take precedence (#5374)
			Force additional rules if true to take precedence over tags, which lets the blacksmith make stone tools/weapons * Fixed lumberjack crafting (was broken due to commit dc4e169). Now both work together. (#5370)
			Fixes missing craft-request check, introduced by dc4e169. Calls tryUnstuck as the first step in the AI's decision-making process, to make sure it tries to free itself as often and early as possible. Migrated recipe-registration of LJ to new checkForWorkerSpecificRecipes() mechanism. Fixed a possible nptr exception (happened once on a testing world) during unstucking. * Add batching to miner resource request when mining (#5364)
			When the miner is mining, inflate resource requests up to 32 to minimize dman trips * Fill in many of the builder-requested recipes (#5363)
			Add tag based recipe support to stonesmeltery Add Redsand recipe to dyer Add sandstone recipes to stonemason Add many other recipes to the other crafters. * Fix things getting lost potentially (#5368) * hotfix #5366 * Add english translation for beekeeper (#5344)

			Fix worker recipes * Feature/buckets (#5312)
			Prefetch materials for builder * Improve construction tape (#5298)
			Construction tape now behaves like a four way block, connecting to tape in all four directions, with the following exceptions: Tape will remember it is a corner even when isolated (unchanged from previous) Tape will not become a T-junction if it means it will face another T-Junction stem-to-stem.

			The rallying banner allows players to summon their guards to them.
			Features Sneak-Rightclicking on a guard building hut adds it / removes it from the rallying list. Right-Clicking in the air opens the GUI, which allows the player to remove Guard Buildings from the list without sneak-rightclicking them. Sneak-Rightclicking in the air or on the ground summons or dismisses the guards to the player. While running to the player, guards will receive a massive speed boost (Speed2 at minimum, but up to Speed5 when highly trained). While rallied, guards will glow in the colony's team color, and are immune to damage from the rallying player. The same is not true the other way around! Guards will return to regular duty when dismissed, or when the banner is not in the player inventory anymore. When an active banner is put back into the player inventory (grabbed from a chest, or moved from slot to slot), chances are that the rallying will proceed. There is a new permission that allows players to rally guards of other people's colonies. Limitations Guards will use a high amount of food while rallied. Currently it's calibrated to reduce the guard to 2 saturation points after 5.5 minutes of rallying. Dismissing the guard while below 2 saturation will remove those 2 saturation, forcing the guard to eat. Guards will only rally within the colony area. Attempting to move them out of the colony will dismiss them automatically. * Update wiki url and delete minecolonies.xml (#5257)
			Fix the wiki url everywhere. This means in CommandHelp.java Delete minecolonies.xml * Add a new reposition approach (#5220)
			Reposition rework:
			Instead of reposition this works now like this:
			Building has button to deconstruct. Calls builder to deconstruct. After this is finished. You get a "Pick Up" button. You get the hut with a colony id and the level in it. On placement with the buildtool that gets applied. * Adds builder name to decoration build complete message (#5223)

		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.15.2-1.4.5-69.jar:
			1.4.5-69 (3 Sep 2020)
			Updates
			* Aerial Interface now supports Industrial Foregoing Essence as an XP fluid.
			* When Charging Station is set to output redstone, frequency of signal changes is now limited to at most once every 10 ticks
			* - This should reduce lag caused by rapid output toggling, which can happen when the charged item is at or around the charging threshold
			* Thermal Compressor GUI: temperature gauge scales have been tweaked to hopefully show a clearer distinction between hot & cold sides
			* Waila now shows 2 decimal places of pressure in the focused block, same as The One Probe already does.
			Fixes
			* Fixed Elevator sometimes entering an air feedback loop, rapidly leading to explosions
			* Fixed Pneumatic Wrench opening machine GUIs when rotating blocks in creative mode
			* Fixed very long words not being split in GUI side tabs, causing unreadably small text
			* - This mainly affects languages such as Chinese, where whitespace is not necessarily used.
			* Fixed heat-tintable blocks (e.g. Compressed Iron Block) flashing blue briefly when placed down
			* Fixed Pneumatic Armor bound keys also triggering when any GUI is open, e.g. typing in a textfield
			* Fixed Liquid Hopper not being able to fill fillable items (buckets, tanks...) dropped in front of the hopper output side.

		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.15.2-1.4.4-64.jar:
			1.4.4-64 (21 Aug 2020)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#updates)Updates
			* Pneumatic Armor HUD now displays only 1 decimal place of pressure for armor pieces
			* - This is not just a cosmetic change, but part of an overall performance improvement with pressure sync'ing
			* - Previously sync'ing pressures of pneumatic items (including armor) was much too chatty in terms of server->client traffic
			* - Now only rounded air levels are sync'd to client, so the client generally knows item pressures with 0.1 bar of precision
			* - This is enough for the vast majority of display purposes; e.g. item pressure tooltips already display with 0.1 bar of precision
			* - Server->client traffic is now greatly reduced, especially for fast-changing pressures such as Jet Boots
			* When placing a Drone down, if the block clicked has no collision box (e.g. flower, crop, etc.) then place the Drone on the that block instead of the adjacent block
			* Drones (with the Pick up Items widget) will no longer "steal" items off Immersive Engineering conveyor belts
			* - Specifically, the widget now honours the "PreventRemoteMovement" entity tag
			* - This can be overridden via the widget's GUI when creating the drone program
			* Tweaked heat & air output of advanced compressors somewhat
			* - All compressors now produce heat proportional to the air produced (adding 1 heat per 20 air/tick produced)
			* - This affects the Flux Compressor in particular, which was producing much less heat per air than the Advanced Compressor & Advanced Liquid Compressor
			* - Flux Compressor now produces double the heat it used to, so yes: this can be considered a nerf!
			* - Heat generation will drop a bit as efficiency drops (since less air is being produced)
			* - Fixed issue where fractional amounts of air/tick were getting rounded down (so compressors may produce very slightly more now, depending on circumstances)
			* Reinforced Stone blocks are now a little easier to mine up (blast resistance has not been changed though)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/1.15/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes
			* Fixed Logistics Frames not being placeable on the Aerial Interface
			* Fixed client desync when placing items (e.g. torches) on a Pressure Chamber block from the offhand
			* Fixed (hopefully) an issue where client-side Logistics Frames would disappear on certain blocks
			* - This also caused a client-side crash if right-clicking a "missing" frame with the Logistics Configurator
			* Fixed Minigun item being rendered too far right in GUI context
			* Fixed occasional client-side crash with Block Tracker helmet upgrade enabled

			* - Just because it has no NBT data doesn't mean actual instances of the item can't...

			* Smart Chest filter slots can now also limit the number of items allowed in a slot
			* - Default limit is the size of the itemstack in the slot when filtering is enabled
			* - Use Alt + mouse wheel (or Alt + key UP/DOWN) to adjust the limit
			* - Hold Shift as well for fast adjustment
			* - Existing Smart Chests from previous worlds will use a limit of 64 (or whatever the item's max stack size is) to avoid changing existing behaviour
			* Omnidirectional Hopper can now use round-robin when exporting items
			* - Default is to try leftmost item first, as before
			* - Use button in GUI to toggle to round-robin export
			* - Could be useful for example when feeding the player via Aerial Interface for a varied diet
			* Aerial Interface in player feed mode now informs the player what they were just fed

			* - Use the Entity Import puzzle piece to do this

			* - Imported orbs are auto-converted to Memory Essence fluid and stored in the drone's internal fluid tank
			* - Conversion is at the standard rate: 1 XP point = 20mB Memory Essence
			* - Use a Fluid Export puzzle piece to deposit imported Memory Essence into any fluid tank
			* - Added config option drones_can_import_xp_orbs (default true) to disable this feature entirely if desired

			* Fixed clientside crash related to minigun tracer rendering with multiple players involved
			* Heat Frame fixes: item dupe and loss issues under some circumstances with both cooking and cooling
			* Fluid tanks with any fluid will now never stack, even with identical fluid & amount (empty Fluid Tanks will still stack)
			* Fixed empty Fluid Tank items being unstackable with other empty tanks after draining in item form (e.g. during heat frame cooling)

		v20.21.0 for Forge 1.15.2:
			* Compatible with Xaero's World Map 1.10.0 or newer. Version 1.10.3 is recommended.
			* Removed multiple waypoints controls from the add/edit screen when editing/adding a single waypoint.
			* Your current coordinates will now be used as placeholders in the waypoint add/edit screen, instead of actually filling the text fields. This means that you no longer need to delete anything from the text fields to input custom coordinates.
			* The automatic waypoint coordinates (now placeholders) will now dimension-scale when switching the sub-world while in the waypoint add/edit screen.
			+ Added a comment to the waypoints save file explaining the structure. Needs resaving to appear.

		v20.20.3 for Forge 1.15.2:
			* Compatible with Xaero's World Map 1.10.0 or newer. Version 1.10.3 is recommended.
			* Fixed minimap/waypoints being loaded for worlds that are never joined.
			* Likely fixed the issue of disconnecting on game join that some people have been experiencing. Although you need to update the world map mod too, since it was an issue in both mods.
			* Dimension-scaled coordinates should now work for all 3 vanilla dimensions. Previously specifically required viewing the Overworld subworld in the Nether. You can now do the opposite, or even replace Overworld with The End. Dimension scales for other (data pack or modded) dimensions can't be assumed (as far as I know) so we'll have to do with this for now.
			* Fixed a bug in a custom math util, which can fix various issues. For example, waypoints being created at coordinate -2 when standing precisely at coordinate -1.0.
			* Fixed FPS drop and log error spam if "List Players" key binding is set to nothing.
			* Improved Croatian and Japanese translations. Huge thank you to COMBOhrenovke and graycat27 for translating!

			* Fixed memory leak caused by fake game connections.
			* Improved exception handling when starting a minimap session on a new game connection.

			* Fixed the mod not resetting the server level id when switching between a sub-server, which includes this mod on the server side, and a sub-server that doesn't.
			* Fixed deathpoints not working when game rule doImmediateRespawn is enabled.
			* All mobs will now be displayed as friendly on the minimap on Peaceful difficulty. Other mods can still make mobs hostile on Peaceful but that's something to fix on their end.
			* Fixed some modded hostile mobs not using the hostile mob color on the minimap but still being affected by the hostile mobs toggle.
			* Fixed text field placeholders being displayed incorrectly when the placeholder text, which can be changed with a resource pack or translation, does not fit the field without scrolling. Although it will still fit a bit less characters than you would expect because of the color code at the beginning. I might rework it to not use the code in the future.
			* Fixed sun light not working correctly on the map. This fix will make the map a bit darker/brighter at night, but that's how it was supposed to be. Might add a slider option for that in the future.

		v20.20.0 for Forge 1.15.2:
			* Compatible with Xaero's World Map 1.10.0 or newer. No longer compatible with older versions.
			+ Added the first server side feature. Installing this mod on the server side (in addition to client) will now make multiworld detection reliable. Although this will change which waypoint sub-world is "auto".
			If you're using the world map mod, then just select your old map and confirm. No further action required as it will also restore your waypoints.
			If you are NOT using the world map, then go to the waypoints menu, select the correct sub-world from the top-right dropdown menu and use Options -> Make Sub-World Auto.
			+ Added a new option "ignoreServerLevelId" to config.txt in XaeroWaypoints for ignoring the new server-controlled sub-world selection.
			* Fixed the mod crashing when installed on server side.
			* Cave detection will now ignore sky light too when the "Ignore Server Heightmaps" option is enabled.
			* Removed API for an old plugin which is out of date and no longer developed.

			+ Added the first server side feature. Installing this mod on the server side (in addition to client) will now make multiworld detection reliable. Although this will change which waypoint sub-world is "auto".
			If you're using the world map mod, then just select your old map and confirm. No further action required as it will also restore your waypoints.
			If you are NOT using the world map, then go to the waypoints menu, select the correct sub-world from the top-right dropdown menu and use Options -> Make Sub-World Auto.
			+ Added a new option "ignoreServerLevelId" to config.txt in XaeroWaypoints for ignoring the new server-controlled sub-world selection.
			* Fixed the mod crashing when installed on server side.
			* Cave detection will now ignore sky light too when the "Ignore Server Heightmaps" option is enabled.
			* Removed API for an old plugin which is out of date and no longer developed.

		v20.19.0 for Forge 1.15.2:
			* Compatible with Xaero's World Map 1.8.0 or newer.
			+ Added a new option for ignoring server heightmaps when updating the minimap or detecting caves. Only use this if the default doesn't work on the server you play on.
			* Started using the new waypoint sharing format that supports text formatting from FTB Utilities. The support for the new format has been added months ago, so even old mod versions will be able receive waypoints from this version.
			* Config button in the mod list will now take you to the mod settings.
			* Improved automatic upscale of the minimap, which should better support screen resolutions as high as 16k. This isn't related to the "Minimap Size" option.
			* Improved the update notification to now include all outdated mods created by me that you have, instead of having to deal with them 1 by 1. This only includes mods that support the improved notification (at least 20.19.0 version of this mod and 1.9.0 for the world map).
			* Improved blending of the player arrow edges.
			* Tweaked chunk loading algorithm to work better on very high framerates.
			* Fixed minimap glitching shortly after joining a world/server if the world brightness is the darkest possible. Mostly affected MC 1.12.2 and older.
			+ (Patron-only) Added the "Don't show again for these updates" button to the automatic update screen.

		v20.18.0.1 for Forge 1.15.2:
			* Compatibility with Xaero's World Map 1.8. No longer compatible with older versions.
			* Fixed the sub-world list trying to find connected sub-worlds on a non-auto world/server, when there are obviously none.
			* The selected sub-world will now switch to the "auto" on death (before creating a deathpoint) to lessen the potential confusion.
			* Temporary deathpoints will now also be created in all world map-based waypoint sub-worlds, but only if a map hasn't been confirmed yet. This way confirming the map only after you die won't switch you to a sub-world without your latest deathpoint.
			* Updated the crash message to include the new preferred bug report link.
			* Fixed the minimap being glitchy on world join when not using the world map mod.
			* Fixed compatibility with fake worlds (again). For example, fixes crash with bspkrsCore.

			* Fixed key events and some other stuff being handled on the server thread causing race conditions.

		v20.17.0 for Forge 1.15.2:
			* Compatible with Xaero's World Map 1.7.4 and newer.
			+ Added a new button to the waypoints menu options for connecting sub-world from different dimensions mainly for the purpose of cross-dimensional teleportation in multiplayer. If you know that a certain Nether sub-world is from the same world save as your current Overworld sub-world (a vanilla Nether portal takes you there), then you can connect the sub-worlds and be able to teleport. This should fix cross-dimensional teleportation for custom maps from the world map mod. Sub-worlds connected to your current one will be marked with a * symbol and are always at the top of the list.
			* The effective "auto" sub-world should no longer change (when it's supposed to otherwise) while you're managing waypoints in the waypoints menu. This means that selecting a non-auto sub-world and using something like "Make sub-world auto" should not have unexpected results if the "auto" sub-world switches in the background.
			* Fixed waypoints sharing not working for sub-worlds created for custom world maps.
			* Fixed clicking "No" in the confirmation screens for waypoints options closing the options menu.
			* Removed the "MP Cross-Dimensional TP" option as it is no longer needed.

		v20.17.0 for Fabric 1.15.2:
			* Compatible with Xaero's World Map 1.7.4 and newer.

		v20.16.0.1 for Forge 1.15.2:
			* Compatibility with Xaero's World Map 1.7.4. Not compatible with older versions.
			* Reworked when objects of certain classes are (re)constructed. Every object that can potentially "break" because of an exception is now constructed per game connection and not per client instance. This should fix compatibility with something like VanillaFix. This means that reloading a world now reloads the main parts of the mod, which also means that all waypoints are reloaded from the files (temporary waypoints disappear). I'm planning to make a similar change to the world map mod.
			* Improved security of the "Make Server/World Auto" and "Make Sub-World Auto" features.
			* Improved security of saving mod settings.

		v20.16.0.1 for Fabric 1.15.2:
			* Requires Fabric API 0.14.1 OR OLDER.

	Xaero's World Map (v1.7.3 for Forge 1.15.2 --> v1.10.3 for Forge 1.15.2):
		v1.10.3 for Forge 1.15.2:
			* Compatible with Xaero's Minimap / Better PVP 20.18.0 or newer. Version 20.20.3 is recommended.
			* Fixed world map components being loaded for worlds that are never joined.
			* Likely fixed the issue of disconnecting on game join that some people have been experiencing. Although you need to update the minimap mod too, since it was an issue in both mods.

		v1.10.1 for Forge 1.15.2:
			* Compatible with Xaero's Minimap / Better PVP 20.18.0 or newer.
			* Fixed the mod not resetting the server level id when switching between a sub-server, which includes this mod on the server side, and a sub-server that doesn't.
			* Fixed entity outline caused by the "Glowing" potion effect not working correctly around held items with this mod installed. This can fix other issues too, so it's not just 1.12.2 and newer.
			* Fixed sun light not working correctly on the map. This fix will make the map a bit darker/brighter at night, but that's how it was supposed to be. Might add a slider option for that in the future.
			* Fixed server level id mode sometimes not working when a dimension takes very long to load.

			* Compatible with Xaero's Minimap / Better PVP 20.18.0 or newer.
			+ Added the first server side feature. Installing this mod on the server side (in addition to client) will now make world map confirmation automatic and reliable.
			IMPORTANT: If you have previously used this mod, make sure to select your old map in the map selection screen (world map -> bottom left icon -> top dropdown menu) and confirm. The mod will pick the correct map from then on. You will have to do this once for every dimension but it's worth it.
			+ Added a new option "ignoreServerLevelId" to server_config.txt for ignoring the new server map selection mode, since it's forced by default.
			* Added automatic map name generation for world spawn and server level id based maps. Previously just displayed the map id, which was causing confusion.
			* Fixed rare race condition during cleanup.
			* Fixed page buttons in mod settings not displaying correctly without the minimap mod.
			* Fixed the mod crashing when installed on server side.

			+ Added a new option to scale world map waypoints.
			* Config button in the mod list will now take you to the mod settings.
			* Increased maximum zoom in from 5x to 50x. Further zoom out is likely coming in the future.
			* Fixed waypoint shadow sprite being affected by global GUI scale.
			* Tweaked chunk loading algorithm to work better on very high framerates.
			* Fixed map scrolling being a little glitchy, especially on older MC versions.
			* Improved the update notification to now include all outdated mods created by me that you have, instead of having to deal with them 1 by 1. This only includes mods that support the improved notification (for example, at least 20.19.0 version of the minimap).
